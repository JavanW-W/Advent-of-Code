.readlines() will return each line of the file as a list item, but those items will include the newline charater (\n)
.read().splitlines() will return each line as a list item without the newline character at the end

break can get you out of a for/while loop when an if condition is met
be careful with breaks in a nested for/while loop!
if you want to iterate while (condition using x) is True for x in a range:
- the for loop is the outer loop
- the while loop must end with a break
- if you want to STOP going through the while loop once you've reached the first time (condition using x) is False
you need to add an if (condition using x) is False followed by a break in the for loop (same level as the while loop)
(maybe there's a cleaner way to do this, I don't know)
- if you put a break at the end of the for loop without a condition, the while loop will only evaluate max one time!

if all(expression using x for x in whatever)

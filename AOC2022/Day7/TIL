How to use the os module to create directories and "pipes" (kind of like named files without having anything in them)

use enumerate() to get index and element in an iterable in a for loop:
i.e. "for index, element in enumerate(list)"

if you do new_list = old_list, you tie them together such that changes to new_list also change old_list
use a shallow copy! new_list = old_list.copy() so that you can reference the original values in old_list

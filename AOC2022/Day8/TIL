.readlines() will return each line of the file as a list item, but those items will include the newline charater (\n)
.read().splitlines() will return each line as a list item without the newline character at the end

break can get you out of a for/while loop when an if condition is met
be careful with breaks!

- initialize x before the while loop
- increcment/decrement x as desired within the while loop
- don't put any breaks!

if all(expression using x for x in whatever) is handy
